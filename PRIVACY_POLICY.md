# Privacy Policy for Contractor Vault

**Last Updated:** December 19, 2025

## Introduction

Contractor Vault ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy protects your information when you use the Contractor Vault browser extension and associated services.

## Data Collection and Usage

We collect and process the minimum amount of data necessary to provide our services.

### 1. Session Data (Core Functionality)
- **Cookies:** When you explicitly choose to "Share" a session, the extension captures the cookies for the current active tab.
- **Usage:** These cookies are encrypted (AES-256) and stored temporarily on our secure backend to enable the "Claim" functionality. They are never decrypted by us and are automatically deleted after the session duration expires (max 24 hours).

### 2. User Information
- **Email Addresses:** We may collect your email address if you choose to provide it for account management or contractor tracking.
- **IP Addresses:** We log IP addresses for security purposes (e.g., "Kill Switch" functionality, Geo-Fencing) and audit logging.

### 3. Permissions Justification
The extension requires specific permissions to function:
- `cookies`: To capture session state for sharing.
- `activeTab`: To identify the current site you wish to share.
- `storage`: To save your preferences (e.g., Theme, Last Used Email).
- `notifications`: To alert you when a session is claimed or revoked.

## Data Sharing

**We do NOT sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties.**
Data is only shared with the specific contractor you provide an access code to, and only for the duration you specify.

## Data Retention

- **Session Cookies:** Automatically deleted from our servers immediately upon session expiration.
- **Audit Logs:** Retained for 30 days for security troubleshooting, then permanently deleted.

## Security

We implement industry-standard security measures:
- All data in transit is encrypted via HTTPS (TLS 1.2+).
- Sensitive data (cookies) is encrypted at rest using Fernet (AES-128-CBC) or better.
- Direct access to the database is restricted.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Revoke any active session immediately via the dashboard ("Kill Switch").
- Request deletion of your account and associated audit logs.
- Export your usage data.
